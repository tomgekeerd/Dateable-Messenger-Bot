# A Facebook messenger bot to chat with other users randomly.

I created this a while ago as a fast side-project with some other guy, eventually he gave up and did not had any time left to finish it. Because its super sad to do nothing with it, I decided it was time to opensource.

Because I was creating a messenger bot and using Heroku and Postgres, I ended up pushing all sorts of things with auto-deploy (it seems to be pretty hard to debug a messenger bot like this in localhost).

I think itâ€™s still a need idea and if anyone wants to use it for any purpose whatshowever, be happy to do so. SQL Injection could be a thing here, please be aware of that. This was just some project what I wanted to finish as fast as possible, but ended up doing nothing.
